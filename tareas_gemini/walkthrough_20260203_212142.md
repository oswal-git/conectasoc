# Walkthrough - Article Editor Customization

Created: 2026-02-03 21:21:42

Implemented customizations for the Quill editors used for Article Title and Summary fields.

## Changes Made

### UI Layer

- **[article_edit_page.dart](file:///n:/flutter/conectasoc/lib/features/articles/presentation/pages/article_edit_page.dart)**:
    - **Quill Toolbars**: Customized the toolbars for Title and Summary to exclude specific options (code block, lists, indent, clear format, quote, check, and links).
    - **Header Selector**: Hidden the header style selector in both toolbars.
    - **Default Styles**:
        - Configured the Title editor to use **Header 1** by default.
        - Configured the Summary editor to use **Normal** text style by default.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification

- Navigated to the article editor.
- Confirmed that the Title toolbar only shows basic formatting (bold, italic, etc.) and alignment, without the excluded buttons.
- Confirmed that the Summary toolbar matches the Title toolbar configuration.
- Verified that new text in the Title field defaults to H1.
- Verified that new text in the Summary field defaults to Normal.
